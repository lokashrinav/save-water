# AquaSpot Overview

AquaSpot is a leak detection system that analyzes Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to find abnormal increases in surface water near pipelines.

## Idea Summary

- **Goal**: Provide an accessible tool for utilities and environmental teams to spot potential pipeline leaks before they escalate.
- **Approach**: Compare satellite images over time using the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and highlight areas of change.

## Project Description

**What it does**

AquaSpot ingests satellite data, calculates NDWI, and reports where sudden water spikes might indicate a leak. Results are available through a command line interface or an easy web interface.

**Who it helps**

Operators monitoring long pipeline networks and environmental agencies can quickly identify suspicious areas and prioritize inspections.

**How it works**

1. Download Sentinelâ€‘2 imagery for the pipeline corridor.
2. Compute NDWI values to map water presence.
3. Detect significant changes between baseline and current imagery.
4. Cluster anomalies and create visual reports.

**Why it matters**

Undetected leaks waste resources and damage local ecosystems. AquaSpot offers a scalable way to monitor pipelines remotely and reduce response times.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```
   For development:
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```
2. Configure environment variables in `.env` as shown in `README.md`.
3. Run the web interface:
   ```bash
   python start_web.py
   ```
   Visit `http://localhost:5000` to upload your pipeline GeoJSON and start analysis.

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.11**
- **Rasterio** and **Shapely** for geospatial processing
- **Geopandas**, **numpy**, and **pandas** for data analysis
- **Flask** and **Streamlit** provide web and CLI interfaces
- **WeasyPrint** generates PDF reports
